            <p>The purpose of this project is to address and mitigate food losses and waste that occur during the farm-to-fork process, with a particular emphasis on fresh agricultural products such as fruits and vegetables.</p>
            <p>Based on a thorough analysis of previous research on pre-harvest and post-fork procedures, the project found gaps in existing methods. Investigations into the potential uses of food waste to assist women, farmers, and the environment were also a focus of research. The findings emphasized that various components of unused, damaged, or discarded fruits and vegetables—such as the fruits themselves, peels, seeds, and fibers—could undergo a transformative process for the betterment of farmers, women, and the environment.</p>
